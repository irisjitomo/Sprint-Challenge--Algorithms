#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(1) I think because all its doing is checking for condition and adding on to variable 'a'


b)  0(n!) you are using a for loop


c) 0(n) cause youre checking for conditions and also have a some sort of recursion in the last line

## Exercise II

In order to find out  the floor in which the egg breaks, there is no way to test it if we dont break an eggs. I would start out drop the egg from the lowest level and build up from there since were dealing with eggs, fragile shells. Once we get our level, store that as value f. If n or floors of building is lower than value f, it would not break. if n is greater than f, the egg would break
